		How It Works
	</h2>
	<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-theme">
		This tool estimates your salary per second by calculating
		your total annual income divided by the number of seconds
		you work in a year. You can input your salary in different
		formats:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4 text-theme">
		<li><strong>Annual:</strong> Your total yearly salary</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Monthly:</strong> Your monthly salary
			(multiplied by 12)
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Hourly:</strong> Your hourly rate (multiplied by
			total working hours)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-theme">
		For working hours, you can specify:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 text-theme">
		<li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Hours worked per week</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Daily:</strong> Hours worked per day (assumes 5
			working days)
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Monthly:</strong> Hours worked per month
			(converted to weekly)
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="text-gray-700 text-theme mt-4">
		The calculation converts everything to annual income based
		on your inputs, then divides by the appropriate time period
		to show your earnings per second, minute, day, week, biweek,
		or month - whatever you prefer to see.
